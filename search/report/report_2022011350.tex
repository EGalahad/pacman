\paragraph*{(a)}
\[\mathcal{O} (n^3)\]

\paragraph*{(b)}
\[ h_i(x_i, y_i) = |x_i - (n - i + 1)| + |y_i - n|\]
Of course,  Manhattan distance is admissible.

May not with other cars, because hopping over cars get a jump of \(2\) with cost of \(1\).

\paragraph*{(c)}
% item use roman number
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item No.
    \item Yes, because hopping only halves the cost needed to the goal.
    \item No.
    \item No.
    \item No.

\subsection{Question 4: A\* Search}
In this problem I implemented A\* search with null heuristic.

\subsection{Question 5: Finding All the Corners}
In this problem I defined state for the problem by supplying the state with a 4-tuple of bool to record which corner have been reached

\subsection{Question 6: Corners Problem: Heuristic}
In this problem I designed a heuristic for 4 corner-search problem.
The heuristic is the minimum cost to reach the goal in a relaxed problem, i.e. without walls, 
 and I consider the four cases separately.

\subsection{Question 7: Eating All The Dots}
I designed four heuristics for this problem, and I will prove that they are consistent.

\paragraph*{(a)}
The first heuristic is the Manhattan distance to the closest dot.

We need to prove \(h(A) \leq h(C) + \text{cost} (A to C)\). 
If \(A\) is a dot, then \(h(A) = 0\). 
If \(C\) is the closest dot of \(A\), then \(h(C) = 0\), \(h(A) = \text{cost}(A to C) = 1\).
Leaving us with the case where \(C\) is not the closest dot of \(A\).
Taking one step from \(A\) to \(C\) can only cause a change of magnitude \(1\) in the Manhattan distance to every dot,
so the heuristic is consistent.
\paragraph*{(b)}
The second heuristic is the Manhattan distance to the furthest dot.

Proof is same as above.
\paragraph*{(c)}
The third heuristic is the distance between two closest dots and the smaller one of the Manhattan distances to the two.

If \(C\) is not a dot, then the two closest dots are not different in evaluating the heuristic, so the proof is same.

If \(C\) is a dot, and \(C\) is one of the two closest dots, then \(h(A) = \text{distance of closest two dots in some set} + 1\) and \(h(C) = \text{distance of closest two dots in some set except C} + \text{some distance larger than 1}\). 
So the heuristic is consistent.
\paragraph*{(d)}
The fourth heuristic is the distance between two furthest dots and the smaller one of the Manhattan distances to the two.

The proof is similar.

\subsection{Question 8: Suboptimal Search}

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../image/q8.png}
    \caption{q8}
    \label{fig:q8}
\end{figure}

The counterexample of closest dot search is inspired by the corners problem. The setting is three dots on the corner and starting point close to the dot in the middle.
